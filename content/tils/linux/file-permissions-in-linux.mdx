**Question 01:** 

While [connecting to a remote server using SSH](https://mahendradani.vercel.app/tils/aws/how-to-ssh-into-aws-ec2), the first step is to change the permissions of the key-pair file using the command : 

<Tabs defaultValue="terminal">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="terminal">Terminal</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="terminal">
    ```bash
    chmod 400 Instance2.pem 
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

Here, [chmod](https://linux.die.net/man/1/chmod) command is used to change permissions of the specified file. But what's the use of 400?

**Question 02:**

When you run `ls -la` it lists all directories and files present in the root, but what's with the `drwxr-xr-x@` and `-rw-r--r--@`?

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/11-02-2025/file-permissions.png"
      height={600}
      width={600}
      alt="File permissions"/>
</div>


...and the solution is (drumroll) __File system in Linux__.

Each directory/file in Linux has associated permissions for users. Users are categorized as follows :
1. **owner** : The owner of the file/dir.
2. **group** : The group that owns the file/dir.
3. **others** : Anyone except the owner and  group.

Each type of user has three permissions for any file/directory : 
1. read(r)
2. write(w)
3. execute(x)

Okay! But what does `drwxr-xr-x@` or `-rw-r--r--@` mean?

As there are 3 permissions for 3 types of users, we can allocate 3 cells to each users. Each cell can have a value 'r', 'w', 'x' or '-' if the user has no permissions. 
> Note that for each user the sequence is same `rwx`.

Then, for each cell we can store 1 if the user has that permission else 0. Thus we convert the chars to binary system.

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/11-02-2025/permissions.png"
      height={600}
      width={600}
      alt="File permissions system"/>
</div>

In 3 bits, we can store values from 0-7 in decimal system, and for three types of user it turns combinations of three values that represent permissions.

As shown in the figure above:
1. owner: permissions `rwx` which in binary system is represented by 111 and in decimal system is 7.
2. group: permissions `r-x` which in binary system is represented by 101 and in decimal system is 5.
3. others: permissions `r-x` which in binary system is represented by 101 and in decimal system is 5.

Combining the result for all types of users gives the three-digit number 755.

Thus, all combinations for permissions can be signified with a 3-digit number instead of `drwxr-xr-x@`.

Combining back to Question 01, can you find out which permissions does a file have with code 400?
<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/11-02-2025/permission-400.png"
      height={600}
      width={600}
      alt="File permissions system"/>
</div>

Observe that, code 400, implies that only owner has read access to the file.
It's significance is that, the `Instance2.pem` contains SHH key-pair which should be stored securely, hence it has only read access.

It's amazing, how much of thought must have went into designing a file system that supports multiple users using the same machine simultaneously with multiple file permissions. And the complexity is reduced to three digit numbers. It's secure, flexible and user-friendly.


Okay! Great! But you don't know what `chmod` command is used for, right? :p
