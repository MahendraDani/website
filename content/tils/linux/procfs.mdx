title: "What is procfs in Linux Kernel?"
description : "The Linux kernel uses procfs, a virtual filesystem at /proc, to manage and expose information about all running processes and system state. It provides a lightweight, text-based interface in RAM that lets you inspect everything from CPU and memory stats to per-process details like command-line arguments, environment variables, and thread info—making process management and monitoring simple and efficient."

**Question**: How does the Linux Kernel handle information of multiple simultaneously running processes and their threads?

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/19-10-2025/procfs.svg"
      height={600}
      width={600}

</div>

Linux Kernel uses **procfs** (`/proc` filesystem), a **virtual filesystem** that provides access to the state of each active process and threads in the system.
- It’s called a **virtual filesystem** because it lives inside of the RAM and consumes no physical storage.
- If the system is shut down or restarted, the RAM is cleared and files of the `/proc` directory are generated from scratch.
- procfs provides a safe, unified, and simple text-based interface for accessing kernel info — almost everything is exposed as if it were just a file.

Let's take a look at the various files and directories inside `/proc`:
<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/19-10-2025/inside-proc-dir.png"
      height={600}
      width={600}
      alt="Result of execution of ls inside /proc"/>
</div>

## System-wide information (/proc)
The files within `/proc` provide the kernel and system-related information.
- `/proc/cpuinfo` - CPU model, cores, cache.
- `/proc/meminfo` - total/free memory, swap, etc.
- `/proc/uptime` - system uptime
- `/proc/loadavg` — system load averages
- `/proc/version` — kernel version, build date and compiler used to build the kernel

For more files, please read the kernel docs.

## Per-Process Information (/proc/PID)
The information related to each running process is stored within the `/proc/PID` directories:
<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/19-10-2025/process-level-info.png"
      height={600}
      width={600}
      alt="Files for each process within /proc/PID"/>
</div>

The most important files are:
- `/proc/PID/cmdline` - command line arguments passed to the process.
- `/proc/PID/cwd` - link to the current working directory.
- `/proc/PID/environ` - values of environment variables used by the process.
- `/proc/PID/exe` - link to executable of the process.
- `/proc/PID/mem` - memory held by this process.
- `/proc/PID/stat` - process status (btw I don't know how to interpret the result of `cat /proc/pid/stat` yet!)
- `/proc/PID/statm` - process memory status information.
- `/proc/PID/status` - process status in human readable form.
- `/proc/PID/task` - Threads created and used by the process.

Here's an example of the status information of a process:
<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/tils/19-10-2025/proc-pid-status.png"
      height={600}
      width={600}
      alt="Status information of a process using /proc/PID/status"/>
</div>

We can see that the name of the process is `sh`, it's currently in sleeping state and the process id is 1. 
Now this makes total sense, as I started the container using the following command and `sh` is the first process that the container executes and hence it's the init process of the system (resulting in PID 1).
```bash
docker run -it node:25-alpine sh
```

So using the `/proc` file system, Linux Kernel can easily manage multiple processes and their related information within the RAM. That's good. The best part is that you can always take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs/proc) to confuse yourself more!
