title: "The Git Object types"
description : "Git stores your repository as a content-addressable system using just four object types: blobs for files, trees for directories, commits for snapshots, and tags as named references. Together, these objects form a directed acyclic graph, letting Git track changes efficiently while you work on your project."

From the [Git Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) docs:

> Git is a content-addressable filesystem. Great. What does that mean? It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store. What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.

So, simply put, git stores the contents of the repository, and uses SHA-1 values as references to 
retrieve them (and much more).

## The Four Object Types in Git
There are only four object types in Git:
1. **Blob** - to store contents of a file.
2. **Tree** - to store directories or other trees
3. **Commit** - snapshot of some blobs + trees, with metadata - author, committer, message, etc.
4. **Tag** - much like named reference to another Git object (mostly commits).

For storing any content (value), git uses [zlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) library to compress the content, then returns a SHA-1 code as a reference (key) to retrieve the content later.

Fun Fact: When a git repository is initalized using `git init`, git creates a directory named `.git` which is the Git directory (datastore). You can always find these objects, under the `.git` folder in any of your Git repositories.

## How Git Stores Data

<MDXImage

 alt="How Git represents your working directory internally — every file becomes a blob, folders become trees, and the entire project snapshot is linked together by a commit object pointing to the root tree"
/>

If we observe the figure above, to the left we can see the directories and files in our project - a basic todo-app server, and to the right we can see how Git stores these contents in the Git Directory as blobs, trees, commits and tags.


`HEAD` acts as the pointer to the current commit, as Git stores the data in the form of [direct acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of the git objects, so using the HEAD, we can traverse through the graph and retrieve the working directory of any commit.

## The Git Object Graph
<MDXImage
  src="/static/tils/29-10-2025/git-data-model.svg"
  alt="The Git data model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) — showing how HEAD points to a branch, which points to a commit, which in turn links to tree and blob objects that represent the project’s files and directories."
/>
Observe how Git stores all the data in files within the `.git` directory can be used to create 
a direct acyclic graph like shown for the todo-app. Also note, how Git here doesn't care about the content of each blob, or tree or commit, it just needs the SHA-1 value to traverse through the graph.

The Git documentation, provides a good explanation via commands to see through how objects are stored, retrieved and used in Git.
