title : "How to find my machine's IP address?"
description : "A quick, hands-on note on what an IP address is and how to find your own machine’s IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from the terminal. Useful when testing networking or socket programs and a good excuse to get comfortable with basic Unix commands like ifconfig, pipes, and grep."

An IP address is a unique identifier that is used to locate/identify any device on a network. There are two types of IP addresses :
1. [IPv4](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ipv4/) : 192.0.2.1
2. [IPv6](https://support.hpe.com/techhub/eginfolib/networking/docs/switches/5120si/cg/5998-8491_l3-ip-svcs_cg/content/436042795.htm#:~:text=IPv6%20address%20format&text=An%20IPv6%20address%20is%20divided,%3A09C0%3A876A%3A130B.) : 2001:0000:130F:0000:0000:09C0:876A:130B.

I have been learning Computer Networking and Socket Programming lately, and I need the IP address of my machine(MacOS/Linux) to test my programs, so I figured it out.

    ```bash
    ifconfig | grep inet
    ```

In the above command, we [pipe](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/) the networking details of the machine returned by [ifconfig](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ifconfig.8.html) command into [grep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) to obtain IPv4 and IPv6 address of the machine.

I'm definitely not going to attach the output screenshot here and reveal my machine's network configs. 

xd.
