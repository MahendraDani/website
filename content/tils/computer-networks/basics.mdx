I am reading computer networks from [Computer Networks: A Top-Down Approach](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/online_lectures.htm) and the following are my notes (raw). 
I write in easy, no-jargon words that are easier to grasp different topics.

## The Internet
1. What is the internet?
    - Nuts and Bolts of Internet 
    - network of infrastructure that provides internet 

## Key Terminologies
1. **End Systems (Hosts)** : laptops, smartphones, TV, smart watches are called **End-system** or **Hosts** in a network.
2. **Communication Links** : End systems are connected together by commnuication links and **Packet switches**.
3. **Transmission Rate** : The rate at with data is transfered. Measured in *bits/secon*d.
4. **Packets** : Packages of information transfered over the network. Chunks of data transported in small bundles (packets).
    - Example : A *cargo*(data) shipment in divided in multiple *trucks*(packets) via *highways* (network).
5. **Packet Switches**: To route packet from source to destination. 
    1. Routers
    2. Link-layer switches
6. **Route (Path)** :  The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending 
end system to the receiving end system is known as a route or path.
7. Internet Service Provider (ISP) : Players like Jio, Airtel, AT&T, BSNL who set up infrastructure, both software and hardware, to provide internet services (connectivity to the *network*) are called ISPs.
8. **Protocols** : The set of rules followed at each stage of data transmission on the network.
    1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    2. Internet Protocol (IP)
9. **Request for Comments (RFCs)** : To resolve network and protocol design problems that faced the precursor to the Internet
10. **Socket Interface** : End systems attached to the Internet provide a socket interface that specifies 
how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver 
data to a specific destination program running on another end system

### Analogy with post office
<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">

      height={600}
      width={580}
      alt="Post Office Analogy"/>
</div>

From the above example, the following analogy can be established:
- Sender -> Alice
- Receiver -> Bob
- Data -> Letter
- Socket interface -> destination on letter, stamp in center (post-office interface)

## Protocols
**A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two 
or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission 
and/or receipt of a message or other event.**

More than *__A set of rules that govern that transmission of data on the internet__*

### Analogy : Human Protocols
After a lecture on, teacher stops to ask,

- "Are there any questions" (message transmitted to, and received by all students in class who are _not sleeping_)
- You raise your hand (transmitting an implicit message to the teacher that you want to ask question)
- Teacher says "Yes" (transmitting message to you to ask question)
- You then ask your question (transmitting your message to the teacher)
- Your teacher hears your question (receiving your message) and the answers (transmitting reply to question).

NOTE : If you don't understand teacher's language (can't receive teacher's message), or no one asks a question (no reply/action from receive) are also probable cases.

> we see that the transmission and receipt of messages, and a set of conventional actions taken when these messages are sent and received, are at the heart  of this question-and-answer protocol

### Network Protocols
A network protocol is similar to a human protocol, except that the entities exchanging messages and taking actions are hardware or software components of some 
device (for example, computer, smartphone, tablet, router, or other network-capable 
device).

> All activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote  entities is governed by a protocol.
Examples:
1. For hardware implemented protocols govern flow of bits in a wire.
2. Congestion-control protocols in end systems control the rate at which packets are transmitted between sender and receiver
3. Protocols in routers determine a packet's path from source to destination

Example : Requesting a web page on the browser
