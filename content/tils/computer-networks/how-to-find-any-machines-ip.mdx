It's not such a big deal, but I [ping](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ping) websites for absolutely no reason!

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
  <Image

    width={600}
    alt="UNIX Ping command"
  />
</div>

[Ping](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ping) command is used to send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts. It is used to check the transmission of packets to host over the network, which signifies the status of the host.

But I use it to find IP address of websites/hosts for fun! 
Sometimes just to check if discord server is down!
