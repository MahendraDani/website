title: "Search an element in biotonic array"
description : "A walk-through of searching in a bitonic array, including a common mistake and why it fails. The key insight is breaking the problem into finding the peak first, then applying binary search on both halves to get a clean O(log N) solution."

An array is said to be **biotonic** if it contains distinct integers such that, the array is monotonically increasing upto index k and then monotonically decreasing.

If the array is plotted on a graph, it forms a mountain-like structure.

The naive approach is to use Linear Search, which runs in O(N) time. The time complexity can be reduced to O(log(N)) using Binary Search.

### Incorrect Algorithm
> Edit (5th Feb) : The following algorithm and code is incorrect for the given problem. 

This algorithm is incorrect, because I assumed that, `target` will surely lie in sorted half, but since in the other half, the element can be present, the following algorithm fails. 

I found this mistake by dry-running the code for `target==4` on the given array.

In every iteration, check which half is sorted, then if *target* lies in the sorted half move in its direction else move in opposite direction.

  <TabsContent value="search">
```cpp
int biotonic_search(int arr[], int n, int target){
  int ans = -1, start =0, end = n-1;
  int mid;
  while(start <= end){
    mid = start + end - 1;

      ans = mid;

    if(arr[start] < arr[mid]){

        end = mid - 1;
      }else{
        start = mid + 1;
      }
    }else{
      if(target>arr[mid] && target<= arr[end]){
        start = mid + 1;
      }else{
        end = mid - 1;

    }

### Correct Algorithm

The correct algorithm for this problem is:

<Tabs defaultValue="search">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="search">biotonic-search.cpp</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="search">
```
1. Find the index k, of the maximum element in biotonic array.
2. ans1 <- binary_search(arr,0,k,target) 
3. ans2 <- binary_search(arr,k+1,n,target)
4. If ans1!=-1, return ans1
5. If ans2!=-1, return ans2 
```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>


The following problems can also be solved by using same approach:
1. Find maximum element in a biotonic array.
2. Find minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
3. Search an element in a rotated sorted array.
