__Problem__: Given an array, check that the pair-wise bitwise AND of all the elements of an array is zero.

The brute force approach is to just _do_ what is given in the problem: bitwise AND each pair in the element, if it's not zero return false.

The time complexity will be O(N^2), where N is the length of the array.

__Question 01__: Given two numbers, what really happens when you perform bitwise AND?

Let's perform bitwise AND operation on 3 and 5.
<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
  <Image
    src="/static/tils/18-03-2025/bitwise-and.svg"
    height={600}
    width={600}
    alt="Bitwise AND of two numbers"
  />
</div>

Observe in the figure that, the `result` contains 1 bit, only if both the bits in operands were 1. That's the truth table of AND gate. I know xd.

To solve our problem we require that the `result` contains all the bits as 0, for each pair in the array. What if we just track the 1 bit after each operation and check that result should not contain any 1 bit? But how?

__Question 02__: Given two numbers, what really happens when you perform bitwise OR?

Let's perform bitwise OR operation on 3 and 5.

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
  <Image
    src="/static/tils/18-03-2025/bitwise-or.svg"
    height={600}
    width={600}
    alt="Bitwise OR of two numbers"
  />
</div>

What can we infer from the result? That bitwise OR will tell us the positions of 1 bit in the result.

How can we use the two results, we learned above and solve the initial problem?

Consider a variable `mask`, for each element we perform bitwise AND with mask, then update mask, with the bitwise OR of mask with current element.

<Tabs defaultValue="bitwise-and">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="bitwise-and">bitwise-and.cpp</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="bitwise-and">
```cpp
bool bitwiseAND(int arr[], int n){
  int mask = 0;
  for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    if(mask & arr[i] !=0)
      return false;

    mask |= arr[i];
  }
  return true;
}
```
</TabsContent>
</Tabs>

The variable `mask` contains the 1 bits, we found in all the previous elements, now if the bitwise AND of `mask` and current element is not equal to zero, that means the current element will not give 0 upon bitwise AND with the element that has 1 bit at a position which couldn't be countered with a 0 bit at that position of current element.

The time complexity in this approach will be O(N), where N is the length of the the array.

I'd suggest dry-running the above code on a valid example such as [3,8,48] and an counter example such as [3,4,5] while keeping a track on how the 1 bit changes in mask.

__Extras__:

1. How can you remove 1 bits from mask of any previous element using bitwise operation? Hint: XOR
2. Try to solve the [Longest Nice Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-nice-subarray/description/) problem as an application of this concept.
