### Challenges
1. The biggest challenge I faced was working with Nextjs and Typescript. Although I had some expirience with using Typescript, Nextjs was completely new to me. Server components and Client components still confuse me!

2. Authentication and Authorization : When I read the docs, I found that there are three libraries provided by supabase @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs and @supabase/ssr and I was confused which one should be used. After a lot of reading and researching I used @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs throughout my projects.

3. TypeErrors : At multiple instances I had to join two tables, but generating and writing types for joins was something that I just couldn't achieve. I used the supabase cli to generate types for my project, but I found writing types for joins very difficult. And their are very few resources I could find on supabase docs related to this. You might find in some files that I have used @ts-ignore to get rid of type-errors xd
