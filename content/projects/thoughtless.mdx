### Abstract

A minimalist web app where you can write whatever's in your head — and it's gone the moment you close the tab.

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
<Image
      src="/static/thoughts/thoughtless.png"
      height={600}
      width={580}
      alt="A minimalist web app where you can write whatever's in your head — and it's gone the moment you close the tab."/>
</div>

- No logins.
- No saving.
- No backspace.
- No edits.
- No history.

Because not every thought needs to be kept.

Some just need to leave.

I built this for people like me — who overthink, who spiral, who bottle things up until it gets too much.
Sometimes, all you need is a blank screen, a keyboard, and no one watching.

Try it. Type something raw. Then walk away lighter.
