Hypothetically, If I could get 2 hours more than everyone else in the world, I would be able to finish everything that I want to and everything that I am supposed to!

I guess it's I am bad at time management. But am I?

I guess I want to do so much that I can I do so less.

Either way, I am in a conflict. A conflict with my choices, ambitions, biases and responsibilites. Okay!
