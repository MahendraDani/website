# Associating achievements with something material
"I worked in amazon for 7 years then I was Sr. Software Developer at Google for 4 years before starting as CEO of Stupify."
We find the man credible for the startup becuase he was associated with companies like Google or Amazon.

I am objecting here, but my question is shouldn't he be proud about what he has learnt/mastered and experienced so that he was capable of working for such big MNCs?
I would like to put it this way -> I am a expert in designing complex software application and developing algorithms hence I got a job at Google/Amazon.

Which one is correct?

Now the same is untrue if the company has not such a _big_ name or reputation, say TCS.
The credibility is completely gone.

If we name the persons in above two cases as A and B. Let's establish a scale for measuring credibilty from 1-5. Then  has A score between 4-5 whereas B has score in 1-2.
