There will be times when the voices in your head won't let you breath. There will be times when these voices will ask questions. Why is it always me? Why everything goes wrong? Why am I dissatisfied with myself? Why should I work? Why shouldn't I choose the ordinary life?

At those times, I need you to read this and not repeat that mistake again. The mistake of giving up. The mistake of losing belief, **losing belief in yourself**. That day I want you to read this with great care and a fresh mind. A still mind that will resonate back with this self. That a question is never just a question that needs to be answered and forgotten. That a project is never just a project. It's a vision. It's a purpose. It's a learning process. And most importantly it's a reflection of yourself to the world. Don't you stop now. Throw those questions and self doubts in the trash can. Clear your mind. Focus. Let the energy flow in the positive direction. Let the mind be curious. Let the mind be limitless. Look up in the sky and don't stop until you find the real source of energy. The light that shines up your world and everybody else's. I need you to remember that no matter how far you try to look, you won't find the source. It's not the Sun that shines your world. And it isn't the moon. It is _you_. **You are the Light**. The light that illuminates the universe. The light that must always illuminate the universe. So don't you stop now. Not today. Don't ever be afraid to make that decision that no one else can. Don't ever be afraid to lean into the pain. Embrace it. Endure it. Learn from it. Arise and conquer. You have to make the choice, the right choice. Remember that we fall to learn to pick ourselves up. And so you must. **You must not stop**. Don't ever let the little things sweat you, get the best of you. Don't ever let yourself be distracted from the purpose. Don't ever let yourself be ignorant. Don't ever get satisfied with even 0.000001% less than what you must achieve. Don't ever stop. Don't ever think that this is it. **Life is not a race and there is no finish line**. There is always a problem that can be solved. And a problem that can be solved should always be solved. Don't ever let the other half take control of your actions. Don't be ignorant of the truth. Don't ever run away from the truth, even if it destroys your deepest believes. **Don't ever let the dark consume you**. Don't ever stop learning. Don't ever stop asking questions. Don't ever stop to be curious. Don't let yourself be down. Don't ever be afraid of making a mistake. Don't ever be afraid to make a decision that you think will be wrong. Because it never will. No decision is right or wrong. It's you who can make a decision right or wrong. It's your actions that determine the outcome of a decision. Your actions matter. **Because the present will become the past my friend**. And the past never returns. But the memories do. The fourth is always watching. And it is you, the fourth. Understand and remember that the present is an outcome of an action that was made in the past. It is always cause and effect. It never is the luck. Remember that those who achieved greatness weren't lucky. They were curious who put their actions in the right direction. Which is the right direction? The North or the South? The right direction is the direction that you chose to be. It is you're decision. I guess then all of this comes down to a single choice: **Get busy living or get busy dying**. So I need you to remember that no matter the circumstances _get busy living_. Get so busy living that you forget the difference between day and night. Let the fire within burn. Let it burn every day, every hour, every minute and every second of your life. Don't every stop burning. Don't burn like the Sun, _burn more_. Burn so more than it frightens the Sun. Remember that it is you who illuminates this universe and no one wants to live in the dark. So when the voices in your head make you anxious, make you question yourself, make you doubt yourself, remember that the fire must never extinguish. It must go on and on and on. Ever and forever. **Burn and be the light of the universe. Be the light that illuminates the living.** Be the light that illuminates the mountains, the skies and the oceans and the unimagined. Be the light that never fades. That's your purpose. And that purpose is **YOU**.
