## A life less random

It's monday morning, you have all the plans ready a day before, you wake up and realize that you missed the alarm and now its 10:30 am instead of 7:00am.
Already critiscizing yourself, you waste another few minutes, get out of bed and plan how to recover from this.
You end up scrolling through social media. The todo list remains untouched. Tasks keep lining up and now its too dificult to get back to work.

Why does this keep happening? [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy) says its human nature.

I don't know. It just doesn't seem fair. When I was little and less smart, I was more optimistic, eager and studious. As I have grown, learnt a great deal from every-day life, I find myself to be very hollow from the inside. I think I am just another idiot on this Earth who can't live up to his goals and aspirations.
I find it strange that I can binge watch a series just to curse myself afterwards that it wasn't the right thing to do in the first place.
The words I hate to hear these days are
- DSA
- Algorithms
- Programming
- Open source
- Academics
- CGPA
- Placements
- Job
- Internship
- Projects
- Hackathons

and these were the exact phrases for which I ___used to___ worked every day. Now that the D-day is approaching I find myself more stressed, more procastinating, more ignorant and more idiot.
why? Why can't I just study for hours like I used to do in my JEE prepration days. WHY?

I look up in the sky and ask myself "what am I good at?", and I don't have a solid answer with full confidence. I don't even remember half the formulae and theorems that I learned and practiced for 2-3 years of my life everyday.
WHY?

I think its becuase I haven't lived upto my asiprations. I haven't worked on what I should have. I haven't studied what I should have. I haven't paid enuogh attention to wherever it was required.
