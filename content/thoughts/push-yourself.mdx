# Push Yourself
Whenever I go on a vacation with my family, espeially in summer, we always stop by to drink chilled sugar cane juice. Sometimes I even drink two or more glasses of it. But I never imagined that there is a robotic machine that can prepare fresh juice!

Yes! It's true. I got to know all about it from [Mr. Milind Datar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milinddatar?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&originalSubdomain=in) the founder of [CaneBot](https://www.canebot.com/) at a talk last month. He was so excited to explain his journey of building a startup from just a raw idea. He talked about developing prototype, scaling it for the market and sustaining his startup during Covid Era.
He said,
> "You either succeed or you learn."

We are always afraid that if I don't do it right I might fail. The fear of failing stops us! If I wanted to start working on anything this thought always slows me down. 

_What if I fail?_ 

Even if you fail, you will be way ahead of _your_ who never started becuase of the fear of failure. Action doesn't *assure* you any sucesss yet inaction assures *guaranteed failure*, why pick inaction?
