# Solving Problems Until I Become Expert

Yes, it's crazy right.

I'm doing it anyway.

I've realised that without problem solving, I'm not confident enough. 

No matter how many hackathons I participate in, no matter how many projects I make, I still **suck** at DSA.

I will learn Algorithms and solve problems everyday as I have been from the past 77 days. The difference is now I have taken it to my pride. I won't give up.

I keep thinking posting everyday on Linkedin is not good. That's true, but I sure can post it on my personal website. Can't I? It's my place afterall and I can post here, who cares?

# Where Am I?

I'm neither a beginner nor advanced. Just another fish in the ocean. 
I have theoritical knowledge of the following concepts:
1. Asymtotic Analysis
2. Arrays and Strings
3. Sorting
4. Binary Serach
5. Linked Lists
6. Recursion

# Resources
Primarily I am going to understand the concepts from the textbook, [Introduction To Algorithms, 3rd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) and solve problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). I will also refer to the following as and when required.

## Practice Sheets
1. [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2) by Striver.
2. [CP-31 Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet) by TLE Eeliminators.
3. [CM Sheet](https://asksenior.in/learn) by Ask Senior.

## YouTube Playlists
1. [Striver's A2Z Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgUwDviBIf0oF6QL8m22w1hIDC1vJ_BHz&feature=shared) by Striver
2. [Competitive Programming Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3ggagradg8MfOZreCMmXMmJ-&feature=shared) by Luv.

Although I don't intend to watch 100s of videos.
