Growth Notes: 23rd August, 2025 - 2nd September, 2025

I haven't done anything of significance in the last 10 days. I solved only 5 problems on Leetcode. I spent my time sleeping, over-thinking and watching a series for absolutely no reason.

## Mistakes
1. Understand what's in your control and what's not. 
2. Don't waste time on something that's beyond your control.
3. Consistency leads to confidence.
4. Watching too much on YouTube is bad. Social Media is bad. The reason is that it makes me impatient.
5. Lack of vision means everyone and everything else around you controls what you should do. This is worse. Don't react to current set of events, have a vision and work for it.
6. When a day's gone, it's gone.
7. Look ahead not behind.
