## Databases
I solved problems on SQL concepts on [sql-practice.com](https://www.sql-practice.com/) and [w3resource.com](https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/). Focused on JOINS and GROUP BY related queries especially.

## Mock Interviews
I gave two mock interviews, where I performed significantly well than before. In DSA problems, the approach was correct but missed in the details. Operating Systems, Projects and AWS related question were handled correctly. The topics that I missed are : 

1. Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching
2. Link-state routing vs Distance vector routing
3. Deadlocks in DBMS
4. Which soft skills do I have?

In addition, I managed to write 2 SQL queries correctly during the mock interview within 10 minutes and in first attempt.
