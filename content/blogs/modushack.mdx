I developed [SnipyAI](https://mahendradani.vercel.app/projects/snipy), a chrome extension that enhances digital reading by integrating Meta Llama 3.1, enabling AI-driven summaries, explanations, and insights, during [ModusHack](https://hashnode.com/hackathons/hypermode), a month long hackathon organized by [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) and [Hypermode](http://hypermode.com/).

I published the following blogs during the Hackathon : 
1. [KickOff](https://mahendra09.hashnode.dev/kickoff)
2. [Research](https://mahendra09.hashnode.dev/modushack-the-research)
3. [The Idea](https://mahendra09.hashnode.dev/modushack-the-idea)
4. [Final Submission](https://mahendra09.hashnode.dev/modus-hack-snipyai)

I'd suggest reading 4 first, then the rest in chronological order.
