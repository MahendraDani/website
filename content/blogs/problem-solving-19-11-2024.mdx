The past few days I had my plate full with side-projects, hackathons and other commitments. I could only solve Leetcode daily problems and maintain my streak. 

I discovered a very good resource which I could refer to, [Aditya Verma](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAdityaVerma) has created playlist on various topics.

I have already started with his playlist on Recursion, and will continue posting blogs everyday.
