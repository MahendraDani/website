I'm building **Spool**, a developer-first, open-source alternative to GitHub Gists — a fast, minimal,platform to create, save, organize, and share code snippets.

Think of it like your personal dev notepad, with folders, workspaces, comments, stars, and privacy controls — all without the limitations of Gist.

# Why another alternative?
As a developer, I often save code snippets, notes, and debug blocks while working across projects. I used GitHub Gists for a while — but eventually, it felt too rigid and limited. No folders, no real organization, no tagging, no custom visibility per snippet, and worst of all: no real control over my content.

I didn't want another heavy "all-in-one" notes tool. I wanted something focused and developer-native.
That's when I thought — why not build a better version from scratch?

This project is for:
- Developers who want to save, search, and reuse their code efficiently
- People who value open-source and want full control over their data
- Anyone tired of messy snippet workflows (sticky notes, random files, clunky tools)

Whether you're building full-stack apps or debugging in terminal — if you write and reuse code snippets, this is for you.

# The Tech Stack
I will develop this project using the modern web dev stack :
1. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - framework
2. [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - language
3. [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - component library
4. [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS
5. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - database
6. [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - ORM
7. [Better-Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) - authentication
8. [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - deployment

I'll share full details of the architecture, schema decisions, and performance optimizations in upcoming posts.

# Why document this journey?
Because building in public is powerful.

I want to:
- Share the wins and the mistakes
- Keep myself accountable and avoid the trap of “unfinished side projects”
- Build community around a tool I genuinely need
- Keep a track of how I navigated around roadblocks and observe my decision-making process.

Every blog post will be a snapshot of progress — from core features to UI design dilemmas and backend optimizations.

# Expected outcomes
By the end of this series, I'll have:

- A fully functional, open-source code snippet platform
- A live hosted version anyone can use
- A GitHub repo for contributors and feedback
- A clearer understanding of what it takes to go from problem to product in public

# Follow along

The main idea behind documenting the journey and building in public is that to get feedback from others. Throughout the process I will make many mistakes and I want to learn from them. I expect you to follow along with me and interact when you find a decision that I made makes no sense to you.

This project was initialized on 02.05.2025 and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/MahendraDani/spool).

I'll keep adding links to all the posts in the series here to browse and search quickly.
