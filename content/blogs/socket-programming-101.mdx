Socket Programming is the core of HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/IP, UDP, FTP protocols used to transfer data over the network from one device to another.

Let's understand the process via a client-server architecture of how sockets are implemented in C programming language.

The server opens a socket, binds it to an IP address and listens at a particular port. The client connects to the port and the server accepts the request and the connection is thus established between the server and the client.

Then they can send and receive data using `send` and `recv` system calls.

I implemented a minimal client-server message transmission application over TCP/IP protocol using socket programming in C, here's the [source code](https://github.com/MahendraDani/socket-chat) with steps to run locally.

Today I truly understood how we send data(packets) from one device to another separated over thousands of miles, via various guided and unguided media.

My implementation establishes connection between two machines that are over same Local Area Network(Hotspot/Wifi), and transfer messages (data) between with each other without needing to connect the machines physically with any wires.
