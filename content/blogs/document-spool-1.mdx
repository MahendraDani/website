In the [introductory post](https://mahendradani.vercel.app/blogs/document-spool) of this series, I announced that I am building a platform for code sharing. In this post, I will explain the reasons of proceeding with this idea, the gaps in existing tools and how I am going to fix them.

# What are the existing tools?
GitHub Gists and GitLab Snippets are the go-to tools for quick code sharing. They're fast, familiar, and widely used — but let's be honest: while they're good, they fall short in some critical areas.

## 1. No organization
Imagine juggling code snippets for school, side projects, freelance work, and production debugging — all in one flat list.
There's no way to organize them by project, tag them by context, or group them meaningfully. You either search by filename or scroll endlessly. It's chaos at scale.

## 2. No collaboration
You get two options: public or private. That's it.
What if you want to share a snippet only with your team? Or collaborate on shared utilities within your organization? That's not possible unless you start using external tools — which defeats the whole purpose.

## 3. "Secret" Gists Aren't Really Secret
Here's a fun (and slightly scary) experiment:
Create a secret GitHub Gist, share the link with a friend… and now anyone with that link can access it.
There's no access control, no audit trail, and no revocation — just obscurity. Spoiler alert: obscurity ≠ privacy.

The next time you want to share a new idea, a clever script, or a work-in-progress snippet with your teammate or co-founder — you sure wouldn't want it accessible to the entire internet, would you?

It's not just about sharing — it's about trust, collaboration, and context.

Tools like Gist served their purpose, but they haven't evolved with the needs of modern developers.
That's why I'm building something better — a snippet manager that's organized, collaborative, secure, and developer-first.

# What are the primary features?
This project is more than just a Gist alternative — it's a reimagined way to store, organize, and collaborate on code snippets with modern developer workflows in mind. Here's what it offers:

-  **Organized Snippets by Design** : Group snippets into folders and workspaces. Whether you're managing school notes, side projects, or internal tools — everything stays structured and searchable.

- **Private by Default, Sharable with Control** : Share snippets with specific teammates, collaborators, or keep them entirely private. No more relying on obscure URLs for sensitive content.

- **Workspaces for Teams** : Collaborate within shared workspaces. Perfect for teams, open-source contributors, or friends hacking on ideas together.

- **Comments and Reactions** : Start discussions on snippets, suggest improvements, or drop feedback — all without switching tools.

- **Clean, Minimal UI** : A distraction-free interface focused on productivity. No clutter — just you and your code.

# The first draft

To visualize the end product, I created a simple dashboard, which will evolve as we will progress further.

<div className="mt-4 flex justify-center items-center">
  <Image
    src="/static/blogs/spool-zero.svg"
    height={600}
    width={600}
    alt="The first draft of spool"
  />
</div>

In the next post, we'll dive into the code and start hacking — beginning with a solid authentication system that supports both email/password and OAuth.
