## Databases
Studied in-depth Normalization, De-Normalization, ACID properties. I used GPT's study and learn mode for revision. Also solved the following problems: 
1. [197](https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/description/)
2. [1581](https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

## Computer Networks
Revised OSI and TCP/IP model, functions, protocols and working of each layer in the OSI model.
Protocols - DHCP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, ARP, IP, Ethernet, etc.

## Operating Systems
Revised OS theory - process scheduling algorithms, critical section problem, memory management - partitioning, segmentation, paging and Deadlocks.

## Object Oriented Programming
Revised few important concepts in OOPs:
1. Constructors - No argument, Parameterized and [Copy Constructors](https://mahendradani.vercel.app/tils/oops/copy-constructors), shallow copy, deep copy.
2. Inheritance - [Why](https://github.com/MahendraDani/programming/blob/main/concepts/oops/inheritance.cpp) we need inheritance, [Types of inheritance](https://github.com/MahendraDani/programming/blob/main/concepts/oops/inheritance-2.cpp), operator overloading, function overloading.


## Aptitude and Reasoning
I missed my weekly target in aptitude, though I've completed almost all topics of Arithmetic, I need to practice more Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning and Non-Verbal Reasoning topics.

1. [Percentage](https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/percentage/)
2. [Blood relations](https://www.indiabix.com/verbal-reasoning/blood-relation-test/)
3. [Verbal Classification](https://www.indiabix.com/logical-reasoning/verbal-classification/)
4. [Surface area and volumes](https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/volume-and-surface-area/ )
5. [Numbers]( https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/numbers/)
6. [Essential Part](https://www.indiabix.com/logical-reasoning/essential-part/)
7. [Pipes and Cisterns](https://www.indiabix.com/aptitude/pipes-and-cistern/)
8. [Mirror images](https://www.indiabix.com/non-verbal-reasoning/mirror-images/)
9. [Classification](https://www.indiabix.com/non-verbal-reasoning/classification/)
10. Coding and Decoding

## Footnotes
1. The past few weeks were rough - faced rejections, failed tests, lots of submissions. Hence the delayed post. Now that I look back, I'm surprised that I still managed to solve many many problems than I was assuming, covered many concepts in almost all the subjects.
2. The direction change happened on 7th August, when the thought came to my mind - _"I've been 
following the schedule since past week or so, let's take a break today"_. Turns out the same thought occurred for a few more days after and before I could realize I had went too far in a different direction. When I did realize that I've not been following schedule, I rebelled and did the exact opposite thinking that I couldn't recover what's left. I should've continued as normal the day I realized and put what's left in backlog to bounce back. 
3. And when I think too much instead of acting, I find Joker asking to my face : _"WHY SO SERIOUS?"_. So I say, "Why so serious?", don't blame for why you failed, instead accept that you DID failed, and ask yourself _"What should I do to NOT fail again?_. [Believe that you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck) and bounce right back with Growth Mindset.
