Yes, I clearly failed on my promise of writing daily about the concepts I learned, but it doesn't mean I stopped learning. I finished Aditya Verma's playlist on [recursion](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeT1ffjiImo0sYTcnLzo-wY&si=nOpGeZ40tVIEOnsx) and solved some problems on Leetcode and Geeks for Geeks. 

It's too difficult for me to strike off everything on my todo-list everyday and seems like writing about this problem solving journey remains on the list as is.

But don't you hope that I would give up on becoming an Expert at solving problems.
