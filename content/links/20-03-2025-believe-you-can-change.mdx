[Aaron](http://www.aaronsw.com/) wonderfully summarizes [Carol Dweck's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) study in which she gives kids to solve challenging puzzles. The kids who failed to solve the puzzles change their state from __struggle__ and __self-doubt__:
> “I never did have a good rememory”

to __disappointment__ and  __frustration__:
> "This isn't fun anymore"

to accepting __defeat__ and __resignation__:
> "I give up"

and finally __ignorance__:
> They started talking about other things, trying to take their mind off the onslaught of tricky puzzles. “There is a talent show this weekend, and I am going to be Shirley Temple,” one girl said.

As I kept reading, I could really see myself in same stages when I faced difficult challenges from my past experiences. 

But the response of successful kids were completely opposite - they showed __determination__ and __persistence__:
> "The harder it gets the harder I need to try"

I believe that's the difference between those who stand out and achieve their goals and those who don't. It's the "growth mindset" that leads. I always revisit to this essay when I feel that I am having the "fixed mindset".

And I always remind myself that : 
> It took a seventh-grader to explain it to her: “I think intelligence is something you have to work for...it isn't just given to you... Most kids, if they're not sure of an answer, will not raise their hand...But what I usually do is raise my hand, because if I'm wrong, then my mistake will be corrected. Or I will raise my hand and say..."I don't get this. Can you help me?" Just by doing that I'm increasing my intelligence.”

So believe that you _can_ get better and focus on growth.
