Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, discuss on the topic "How can India innovate better?". He begins by explaining the difference between _Discovery_, _Invention_ and _Innovation_ with examples.

He says:
> History has proven that those who dared to imagine the impossible are the ones who break all the human limitations.

He gives examples of great minds to prove his point, that those who can imagine and put in the effort are capable of achieving the impossible.

I don't think anyone would've thought when Alexander Graham Bell [_discovered_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_telephone#:~:text=Alexander%20Graham%20Bell%20was%20awarded,of%20the%20telephone%20in%201876.) the telephone in 1876, it would've been possible that one could connect with anyone over the world using the internet. But here you are reading this, essentially exchanging knowledge.

Dr. Kalam, gives example of [C.V. Raman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._V._Raman) who won the nobel prize for Raman effect in the field of scattering of light : 

> When sir C.V. Raman was travelling overseas from U.K to Kolkata, he saw the sea was blue and the sky was blue when the sun was shining in the evening he asked "why" and he got a nobel prize.

Curiosity, Imagination and Hardwork are the characteristics of great people.

Dr. Kalam makes the audience recite the following lines, and it's one of the poems I would always come back to!

> Imagination leads to creativity,
>
> creativity blossoms thinking,
>
> thinking provides knowledge,
>
> knowledge results innovation,
>
> innovation makes the nation great
